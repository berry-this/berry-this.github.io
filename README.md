## Key Features

-   **Maximum Performance:** Telemetry, spyware modules, and resource-intensive background processes have been surgically removed.
-   **Full Control:** Windows Update and Microsoft Defender are disabled. You decide when to update and what security stack to use.
-   **Universal Compatibility:** Artificial installation restrictions (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, RAM requirements) have been lifted.
-   **Privacy by Default:** Microsoft Edge is completely gone. Installation requires only a local account.
-   **Compact & Optimized:** The installed system footprint is significantly reduced by removing dozens of unnecessary UWP apps and components.
-   **Post-Install Helper:** Includes a script for deep telemetry cleaning, classic context menu tweaks, and quick software installation.
